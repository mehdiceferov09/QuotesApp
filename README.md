# Quotes app
This is a windoes form quotes app.
You can get a random quote from 10 quotes.

# How it works.
When you press the button it randomly picks a number between 0-10.
After that it adds that number to a list and shows you a quote with that index in quotes list.
Everytime you press the button it generates a new random number and checks if that index is used before.
If yes it genrates again until it is a new one and if there is no new numbers to genrate the index list clears and starts over.
